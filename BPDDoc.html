      <p>BPD <em>(Borderline Personality Disorder)</em> is one of the most common personality disorders in clinical discovery. It is present in culture from around the world. It [BPD] is often incorrectly diagnosed or underdiagnosed in clinical practice due to the multifacets of the symptoms in individual patients. BPD causes marked distress and impairment in social, occupational, and role-functioning, and is associated with high rate of self-destructive behavior including suicide. Most often than not, many professionals have overlooked symptoms due to thier close resemblance to other personality disorders. </p>
      <p>As BPD causes issues many familial relationships, it can affect the patients behavior, self-image, and impulsivity. To be aware of the symptoms and triggers is a must have for family, friends, and romantic relationships.</p>

      <p>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a condition characterized by difficulties regulating emotion. This means that people who experience BPD feel emotions intensely and for extended periods of time, and it is harder for them to return to a stable baseline after an emotionally triggering event.</p>

      <p>With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships.</p>

      <p>Borderline personality disorder usually starts in late childhood. The condition seems to get worse in young adulthood and may gradually get better with age.</p>

        This document is a practical guide to helping bring understanding to this disorder and the people who suffer from it. Management of patients (primarily adults over the age of 18) with borderline personality disorder, represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and rational clinical practice. This guideline strives to be as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical approach to treatment. The process is detailed in a document available from the APA Department of Quality Improvement and Psychiatric Services: the “APA Guideline Development Process.” Key features of the process include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive literature review and development of evidence table</li>
        <li>Initial  drafting  by  a  work  group  that  included  psychiatrists  with  clinical  and  researchexpertise in borderline personality disorder</li>
        <li>The production of multiple drafts with widespread review, in which 13 organizations andmore than 60 individuals submitted significant comments</li>
        <li>Approval by the APA Assembly and Board of Trustees</li>
        <li>Planned revisions at regular intervals</li>

    <article>
      <p>People with BPD experience wide mood swings and can display a great sense of instability and insecurity. Per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnostic framework, some key signs and symptoms may include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment by friends and family.</li>
        <li>Unstable personal relationships that alternate between idealization (“I’m so in love!”) and devaluation (“I hate her”). This is also sometimes known as "splitting."</li>
        <li>Distorted and unstable self-image, which affects moods, values, opinions, goals and relationships.</li>
        <li>Impulsive behaviors that can have dangerous outcomes, such as excessive spending, unsafe sex, substance abuse or reckless driving.</li>
        <li>Self-harming behavior including suicidal threats or attempts.</li>
        <li>Periods of intense depressed mood, irritability or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days.</li>
        <li>Chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness.</li>
        <li>Inappropriate, intense or uncontrollable anger—often followed by shame and guilt.</li>
        <li>Dissociative feelings—disconnecting from your thoughts or sense of identity or “out of body” type of feelings—and stress-related paranoid thoughts. Severe cases of stress can also lead to brief psychotic episodes.</li>

      <header>Risk Factors</header>
      <article>
        <p>The cause of BPD is not yet clear, but research suggests that genetics, brain structure and function, and environmental, cultural, and social factors play a role, or may increase the risk for developing BPD.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Family History.</strong> People who have a close family member, such as a parent or sibling with the disorder may be at higher risk of developing borderline personality disorder.</li>
          <li><strong>Brain Factors.</strong> Studies show that people with borderline personality disorder can have structural and functional changes in the brain especially in the areas that control impulses and emotional regulation. But is it not clear whether these changes are risk factors for the disorder, or caused by the disorder.</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental, Cultural, and Social Factors.</strong> Many people with borderline personality disorder report experiencing traumatic life events, such as abuse, abandonment, or adversity during childhood. Others may have been exposed to unstable, invalidating relationships, and hostile conflicts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Although these factors may increase a person’s risk, it does not mean that the person will develop borderline personality disorder. Likewise, there may be people without these risk factors who will develop borderline personality disorder in their lifetime.

      <header>Diagnosis Differential</header>
      <article>
        <p>Borderline personality disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, and when criteria for bothare met, both should be diagnosed. However, some features of borderline personality disordermay overlap with those of mood disorders, complicating the differential diagnostic assessment.For example, the affective instability and impulsivity of borderline personality disorder maymimic features of bipolar disorder, especially bipolar II disorder.</p>

        <p>
           However, in borderline per-sonality disorder, the mood swings are often triggered by interpersonal stressors (e.g., rejection),and a particular mood is usually less sustained than in bipolar disorder. Depressive features maymeet criteria for major depressive disorder or may be features of the borderline personality dis-order itself. Depressive features that appear particularly characteristic of borderline personalitydisorder are emptiness, self-condemnation, abandonment fears, self-destructiveness, and hope-lessnes.
        </p>

        <p> It can be particularly difficult to differentiate dysthymic disorder from bor-derline personality disorder, given that chronic dysphoria is so common in individuals withborderline personality disorder. However, the presence of the aforementioned affective features(e.g., mood swings triggered by interpersonal stressors) should prompt consideration of the di-agnosis of borderline personality disorder. In addition, the other features of borderline person-ality disorder (e.g., identity disturbance, chronic self-destructive behaviors, frantic efforts toavoid abandonment) are generally not characteristic of axis I mood disorders. In other cases,what appear to be features of borderline personality disorder may constitute symptoms of anaxis I disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder). A more in-depth consideration of the differential diag-nosis or treatment of the presumed axis I condition may help clarify such questions. </p>

      <header>Treatments and Therapies</header>
      <article>
        <p>Borderline personality disorder has historically been viewed as difficult to treat. But, with newer, evidence-based treatment, many people with the disorder experience fewer or less severe symptoms, and an improved quality of life. It is important that people with borderline personality disorder receive evidence-based, specialized treatment from an appropriately trained provider. Other types of treatment, or treatment provided by a doctor or therapist who is not appropriately trained, may not benefit the person.

Many factors affect the length of time it takes for symptoms to improve once treatment begins, so it is important for people with borderline personality disorder and their loved ones to be patient and to receive appropriate support during treatment.</p>

        <h2>Tests and Diagnosis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A licensed mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker) experienced in diagnosing and treating mental disorders can diagnose borderline personality disorder by: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completing a thorough interview, including a discussion about symptoms</li>
          <li>Performing a careful and thorough medical exam, which can help rule out other possible causes of symptoms</li>
          <li>Asking about family medical histories, including any history of mental illness</li>
          <p>Borderline personality disorder often occurs with other mental illnesses. Co-occurring disorders can make it harder to diagnose and treat borderline personality disorder, especially if symptoms of other illnesses overlap with the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. For example, a person with borderline personality disorder may be more likely to also experience symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or eating disorders.</p>
          <h2>Seek and Stick with Treatment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>More likely to develop other chronic medical or mental illneses</li>
            <li>Less likely to make healthy lifestyle choices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Borderline personality disorder is also associated with a significantly higher rate of self-harm and suicidal behavior than the general public.</p>
          <p><b>People with borderline personality disorder who are thinking of harming themselves or attempting suicide need help right away.</b></p>
<br>
            <p><b>If you or someone you know is in crisis, </b>If you or someone you know is in crisis, call the toll-free <a class="NSPLHotline" href="http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL)</a> at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is available to everyone.</p>

          <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
          <p>Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. A therapist can provide one-on-one treatment between the therapist and patient, or treatment in a group setting. Therapist-led group sessions may help teach people with borderline personality disorder how to interact with others and how to effectively express themselves.</p>

<p>It is important that people in therapy get along with, and trust their therapist. The very nature of borderline personality disorder can make it difficult for people with the disorder to maintain a comfortable and trusting bond with their therapist.</p>

            <p>Two examples of psychotherapies used to treat borderline personality disorder include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): </strong> This type of therapy was developed for individuals with borderline personality disorder. DBT uses concepts of mindfulness and acceptance or being aware of and attentive to the current situation and emotional state. DBT also teaches skills that can help:<ul>
              <li>Control intense emotions</li>
              <li>Reduce self-destructive behaviors</li>
              <li>Improve relationships</li>
              </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): </strong>This type of therapy can help people with borderline personality disorder identify and change core beliefs and behaviors that underlie inaccurate perceptions of themselves and others, and problems interacting with others. CBT may help reduce a range of mood and anxiety symptoms and reduce the number of suicidal or self-harming behaviors.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Medications</h2>
          <p>Because the benefits are unclear, medications are not typically used as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder. However, in some cases, a psychiatrist may recommend medications to treat specific symptoms such as: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mood swings</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Other co-occuring mental disorders</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Treatment with medications may require care from more than one medical professional.</p>

<p>Certain medications can cause different side effects in different people. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from a particular medication.</p>

            The causes of BPD are not fully understood, but scientists agree that it is the result of a combination of factors, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> While no specific gene or gene profile has been shown to directly cause BPD, studies involving twins suggest this illness has strong hereditary links. BPD is about five times more common among people who have a first-degree relative with the disorder.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental factors.</strong> People who experience traumatic life events—such as physical or sexual abuse during childhood or neglect and separation from parents—are at increased risk of developing BPD.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain function.</strong> The emotional regulation system may be different in people with BPD, suggesting that there is a neurological basis for some of the symptoms. Specifically, the portions of the brain that control emotions and decision-making/judgment may not communicate optimally with one another. </li>
